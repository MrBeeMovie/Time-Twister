# README

This project was made in Unity in order to experiment with time based mechanics. Time can be stopped and started by pressing the Q and E keys in game. Physics objects can be picked up and thrown using the left mouse button. Builds can be found in the builds directory. Currently there is only a build for Windows OS included.
